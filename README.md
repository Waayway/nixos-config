### Why NixOS

#### Bazzite

I recently switched to bazzite from windows for gaming. This is mostly because i couldn't get the performance i wanted on Nix with Hyprland in the past. 

Bazzite is generally a good distro/OS but... 

I hate it for terminal. It works great for everything except developing which is generally why i wanted to switch to linux in the first place. 

And NixOS worked the best out of all distros i have tried in the past. 

#### NixOS

I discovered Nixos somewhere in 2023 And basically loved it from the start. 99% of what i needed to do was a package and i didn't have to work with an AUR which i had to fumble with every other week. 

Nixos has been very stable for me with minimal problems and with a possibility to explore some more devops.
